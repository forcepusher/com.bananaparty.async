# com.bananaparty.async  
  
Unity package. Library for asynchronous programming in a strict-OOP domain space.  
In contrast to traditional language-specific patterns, it does not rely on a static execution context.  
  
Make sure you have standalone [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed first.  
In Unity, open "Window" -> "Package Manager".  
Click the "+" sign on top left corner -> "Add package from git URL..."  
Paste this: `https://github.com/forcepusher/com.bananaparty.async.git`  
  
All of these are not suitable for strict-OOP programming. They've copied the same mistake from each other.
